The dream begins
In 2013, Griffin Hammond wanted to turn his burning (haha) passion for Sriracha hot sauce into a short documentary about the enigmatic yet familiar green-capped pop culture phenomenon. On his journey to discover and share where Sriracha comes from and why people love it, Griffin had to employ creative grassroots promotion to make his dream documentary a reality. Keep reading for his practical advice on how to get press for your film without breaking the bank!


1. Make it easy for fans to learn more and spread the word Before Griffin even began filming his documentary, he knew Sriracha had an existing fan base that he could activate for grassroots promotion. To keep in touch with them, Griffin set up a Tumblr site for the film where he could post updates. He also created a Facebook page, a Twitter handle, and a Pinterest board. This made it easy for fans to point friends to a place to find info about the film. The one thing Griffin says he regrets is that he didn’t create a form to collect email addresses from fans in the early stages — both he and we strongly recommend building a mailing list as early as possible!

Introducing Radiant Version 1.1! To read about all the new changes, go here, or check out the new Radiant here.
Yesterday Starr Hill Brewery announced their brand redesign that we have been working on over the last several months. In addition to the new logo, Storyware has been working with Starr Hill to redesign all of their packaging that will be hitting the shelves from Pennsylvania to Alabama this summer. Last, but not least, we are building a new responsive website for Starr Hill on top of WordPress.
We are really excited to be working with such a strong brand, passionate customer base, and the great people at Starr Hill and can’t wait to show you the new look in a few months.

Whether it’s a trend or a fad, one thing’s for sure: thirst for craft beer has never been stronger. At Layman’s Guide to Beer, co-founders Zach and Elspeth Harris are cutting through the craft beer snobbery and helping make craft beer understandable to beer novices everywhere.
Zach and Elspeth write about craft beer culture because they love craft beer, but also because they want to make craft beer more approachable for people who are intimidated by all the brands and styles of beer flooding the shelves. It can be intimidating to walk into the beer aisle of the grocery store because of the overwhelming selection of craft six-packs with odd names. Layman’s Guide to Beer wants to make the entry point into craft beer more accessible for the uninitiated.
The culture of craft beer is changing as more and more small local breweries spring up in big cities and small towns alike. According to Zach, there has never been this kind of variety or experimentation available to consumers in just about any market. It used to be that there were only a couple cheap adjunct lagers from big beverage conglomerates available in the cooler at any given store. The big companies couldn’t anticipate the consumer’s desire for high-quality, genuinely local beer. The craft beer market has rapidly taken up a solid and growing foundation in the minds of consumers, and the rising demand keeps generating new and interesting beers.
With Layman’s Guide to Beer, Zach and Elspeth want to provide a place to discuss what makes beer great and the changes in the beer industry. They see a lot of Tumblr users re-blogging Layman’s posts and commenting on the beers they enjoy and their own experiences. For a while, Zach and Elspeth were using a different hosting service for their full site and only using Tumblr for small posts. Then, they noticed greater interest and readership on the Tumblr blog and realized that they could sustain their content and serve their mission better in Tumblr’s ecosystem. In the course of switching over the Tumblr, they decided upon our Mallow theme because of the plethora of customization options available. Zach says: “Mallow’s flexibility and Storyware’s support make it easier for me to maintain the design I want without have to do so from scratch.”
To get a glimpse into the craft beer world, check out Layman’s Guide to Beer. To purchase our Mallow theme, go here.

Fashion has always had a sizable presence on Tumblr – but it’s no secret that men’s fashion often takes a back seat to women’s fashion in both the real and the online world. At Sartoriale, men’s clothing and accessories are put right in the spotlight.
Sartoriale is a men’s luxury clothing and accessories shop that offers handmade, high-quality pieces online. When company founder Gabor Halmos, a long-time enthusiast of suits and vintage pieces, moved from Europe to New York in 1996, he found himself buying lots of suits and men’s pieces. With an overflowing apartment in Hell’s Kitchen, Gabor decided to start selling some of his many suits. After discovering that his pieces garnered interest from buyers, Gabor began hunting for specialty men’s suits and accessories – and found that many prominent men were interested in his high-end designer items!
Ten years ago, Gabor started seeking out high-end clothing makers and even visited the capital of high-end ready-to-wear: Napoli, Italy. Over the years, Sartoriale has grown and become perhaps the best online store in its segment.
On the Sartoriale Tumblr blog, Gabor likes to highlight all kinds of men’s clothing, from suits and shoes to bags and even umbrellas. Just recently, Sartoriale received a historical collection of bespoke suits and jackets from Rubinacci (“the inventors of the Neapolitan suit”), and the collection has been the focus of a popular post on the Sartoriale blog. Gabor also likes to use the Sartoriale blog to highlight small artisan workshops from all over the world that make items which stand out from the mass-produced culture, including the Talarico family’s handmade umbrellas.
So what trends in men’s fashion are big in 2015? The aficionados at Sartoriale are excited that classic, high-quality tailored pieces are making a comeback. As Gabor says, men are re-discovering that nothing looks and feels better than a classic silhouette. Men’s fashion-centric Tumblr blogs are helping to bring men’s style to the forefront, and the Sartoriale blog has become an exceptional spot to keep up with trends in high-end, handmade men’s clothing.
For Gabor, Tumblr is a great place to host the Sartoriale blog because it’s a space where men’s style is widely discussed and visible. When he was searching for a Tumblr theme, he went through hundreds of themes before settling on our Mallow theme because of its beautiful, minimalist layout, on the screen and on mobile devices. We’re so glad Gabor thinks so!
To stay on top of trends in high-end, handmade men’s clothing, check out the Sartoriale blog. To purchase our Mallow theme, go here.
At Storyware, we strive to make our themes intuitive and user-friendly as well as good-looking. We also understand that everybody needs an occasional hand to get the most out of all those features, and it’s our pleasure to help.

Technologies like cookies, pixel tags ("pixels"), device or other identifiers and local storage (collectively, “Cookies and similar technologies”) are used to deliver, secure, and understand products, services, and ads, on and off the Facebook Services.
We offer a range of products and features that involve the use of these technologies to reach you based on your activity on and off our Services. You can learn more about our advertising products and the controls you have by visiting our “Advertising on Facebook” page. As described in more detail below, we also use these technologies in other ways, like for security purposes, to deliver and enable products and services, as well as to understand and measure products, services and advertisements. Third parties that you interact with as you use the Facebook Services may also use these technologies for a variety of purposes.
Check back here from time to time to get the latest information about these technologies and how they are used.
Your browser or device may offer settings related to these technologies. For more information about whether these settings are available, what they do, and how they work, visit your browser or device's help material. We may not recognize or respond to browser or device signals around tracking, and some settings may interfere with your use of features we offer. Additionally, the settings offered by a browser or device often only apply to that particular browser or device.
What are some of these technologies?
Cookies are small files that are placed on your browser or device by the website or app you’re using or ad you’re viewing. Pixel tags (also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels) are small blocks of code on a webpage or app that allow them to do things like read and place cookies and transmit information to us or our partners. The resulting connection can include information such as a device’s IP address, the time a person viewed the pixel, an identifier associated with the browser or device and the type of browser being used. Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or app to store and retrieve data on a person’s computer, mobile phone or other device. Some examples include device or HTML5 local storage and caching.
Why do we use cookies and similar technologies?
We use these technologies for a variety of reasons, such as allowing us to show you content and advertising that’s most relevant to you; improving our products and services; and helping to keep our Services secure. While specific names of the Cookies and similar technologies that we use may change from time to time as we improve and update our Services, they generally fall into the below categories of use:
These technologies tell us when you’re logged in, so we can show you the appropriate experience and features.
For example, Cookies and similar technologies tell us when you are logged in to Facebook so we can show you relevant and social information when you visit other websites that use our social plugins. We also use this information to understand how you use our Platform and other apps and services.
These help keep Facebook Services safe and secure. They support or enable security features and help us detect activity that violates our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.
For example, they help protect your account from being accessed by anyone other than you. Cookies and similar technologies also let us know when several people have logged in from the same computer. With login approvals if someone logs into your account from a browser you’ve never used before, we may block them and ask for more information. They also help us implement login notifications, so you can be alerted when your account is accessed and disable any active sessions.
Besides helping to keep unauthorized people from logging into your account, we also use Cookies and similar technologies to help make sure the people or machines that access our Services don’t violate our policies. For example, certain information on Facebook is public and therefore can be accessed by anyone on the internet. These Cookies and similar technologies help us understand the volume and frequency of requests so we can detect and stop people or machines from “scraping” information from our site.
We also use these tools to make Facebook easier to use, like when you mistype one character of your username or password. If you’ve already logged into Facebook from the same browser, we’ll give you easier options to correct your typo since we know you’ve successfully logged into Facebook before.
Things like Cookies and similar technologies (such as information about your device or a pixel on a website) are used to understand and deliver ads, make them more relevant to you, and analyze products and services and the use of those products and services.
For example, we use cookies so we, or our affiliates and partners, can serve you ads that may be interesting to you on Facebook Services or other websites and mobile applications. We may also use a cookie to learn whether someone who was served an ad on Facebook Services later makes a purchase on the advertiser’s site or installs the advertised app. Similarly, our partners may use a cookie or another similar technology to determine whether we’ve served an ad and how it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with them. We also may work with an advertiser or its marketing partners to serve you an ad on or off Facebook Services, such as after you’ve visited the advertiser’s site or app, or show you an ad based on the websites you visit or the apps you use – all across the Internet and mobile ecosystem.
We also may use Cookies to provide advertisers with insights about the people who see and interact with their ads, visit their websites, and use their apps.
Learn more about the information we receive, how we decide which ads to show you on and off Facebook Services, and the controls available to you.
These help us provide localized experiences.
For example, we may store information in a cookie that is placed on your browser or device so you will see the site in your preferred language.
These provide functionality that help us deliver products and services.
For example, Cookies or similar technologies help you log in by pre-filling the username field and help make chat a better experience by showing which of your friends are online. We may also use Cookies and similar technologies to help us store preferences, know when you’ve seen or interacted with Facebook Services’ content, and provide you and others with social plugins and other customized content and experiences, such as making suggestions to you and others. Learn more.
We use these to provide you with the best experience possible.
For example, we may use Cookies or similar technologies to help us route traffic between servers and understand how quickly Facebook Services load for different people. Sometimes we may store information on your browser or device so features you are using load and respond faster.
These are used to understand, improve, and research products and services, including when you access Facebook Services or other websites and apps from a computer or mobile device.
For example, we may use Cookies or similar technologies (including information from your device) to understand how you are using social plugins to improve them. We may share information about this analysis with our partners.
You can also take a look at the cookies section of our publicly available audit, carried out by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in Ireland, which explains more about the cookies we use.
How do we use cookies, local storage or similar technologies when you use a mobile device?
Many mobile devices act just like computers, such as smart phones that support full-featured browsers. For those devices, we and our partners use Cookies and similar technologies in ways that are similar to when you are accessing the web from a computer. Other devices use different technologies such as local storage on a device, Software Development Kits (SDKs) or Advanced Programming Interfaces (APIs) to facilitate the same types of processes we use Cookies for, as described above.
We may obtain or receive information about your use of your device, our apps, or other apps. As on the web, we also may use these technologies to store an identifier or other information on your device. We describe how we use these technologies and the information we received through their use above. For example, if we learn that you’re already using an app, when you click on a link in News Feed from that app, we can send you directly to that app. If you don’t have the app, we would instead send you to an app store so you could download the app.
How do we use cookies for security purposes?
We use tools like cookies to help keep Facebook Services safe, secure and easy to use. Cookies support or enable security features. For example, with login approvals if someone logs into your account from a browser you’ve never used before, we may block them and ask for more information. They also help us implement login notifications, so you can be alerted when your account is accessed under suspicious circumstances and disable any active Facebook sessions.
Besides helping to keep unauthorized people from logging into your account, we also use cookies to help make sure the people or machines that access our Services don’t violate our policies. For example, certain information on our Services is public and therefore can be accessed by anyone on the Internet. These cookies help us understanding the volume and frequency of requests so we can detect and stop people or machines from “scraping” information from our site.
We also use these tools to make our Services easier to use, like when you mistype one character of your username or password. For example, if you’ve already logged into Facebook from the same browser, we’ll give you easier options to correct your typo since we know you’ve successfully logged into Facebook before.
When might we use cookies, device identifiers, local storage or similar technologies?
We may place or use these technologies when you interact with our Services, our related companies, or with an advertiser or partner (whether or not you are logged in to the particular Service) using a browser or device that permits the placement or use of the relevant technology. For example, when you visit our site or use our app, we may place or read cookies or receive information from your devices. We may also place cookies through a pixel on an advertiser’s or partner’s site.
When might we read the cookies on your computer or device?
Web browsers send any cookies for a particular web domain (ex: facebook.com) to the website each time a machine with those cookies accesses content served from that domain. This means that any facebook.com cookies will be sent to Facebook when any page is accessed at facebook.com by that machine. It also means that these cookies are sent to Facebook when someone accesses a third-party website or application that integrates or uses our Services, like one of our plugins.
Sometimes we work with websites, apps and their partners so that we can place or read Facebook cookies on your browsers or devices when you visit third-party services. This allows us to do things like read and reference cookies from more than one device or browser that you use, on and off of our Services, so we can provide you Facebook Services across all of your devices and improve and understand the products, ads and services we offer to you and others across the Internet.
How do third parties use cookies, pixel tags ("pixels") and other similar technologies on our Services?
We sometimes use service providers to help us provide certain products and services. For example, we use service providers to help you buy things using Facebook on your mobile phone. As part of those services, a provider may use a pixel to collect information about your phone so that, if you choose, it can help us conveniently bill you through your regular phone bill.
When you view, click or otherwise interact with an ad or app on or off Facebook, our partners also use cookies, pixels or similar technologies (like local storage or information from your device), to help provide you with relevant services and ads. For example, a platform partner may use cookies, software developer kits (SDKs) or similar technologies to customize your experience while you’re using their app. Or, an advertising partner may use a cookie to decide whether they want us to show you one of their ads or to measure the performance of the ads you see. Our partners also may use these technologies to help share information with our Services, like how you use their website or app.
We or others (like your friends in their posts or the Pages or apps you visit or use) may integrate third party features like maps or videos to provide you with better services. The providers of those integrations may collect information when you view or use them, including information about you and your device or browser. They may do this using Cookies or similar technologies. To learn more about the information they collect or receive, review their privacy policies.
How do we use Cookies and similar technologies to show relevant ads?
We use Cookies and similar technologies to show you ads on and off Facebook Services. Learn more about how Facebook decides which ads to show you and the controls available to you. You can adjust your ad preferences if you want to control and manage your ad experience on Facebook.
The advertising companies we work with generally use cookies and similar technologies as part of their services. When they do so, they often adhere to industry-standard controls that you can use or they may offer other choices as well. To learn more about how advertisers generally use cookies and the choices they offer, you can review the following resources:
We work with advertising companies to help advertisers show people ads based on other websites or apps those people have visited, among other factors. This helps us show you more useful and relevant ads. For example, if an advertiser is promoting an airline sale to Hawaii, they might want to show their ad to people who recently visited websites related to traveling to Hawaii. We work with an advertising company to help that advertiser show the airline sale ad those people.
We also authorize certain companies that provide service to advertisers to measure the impact of the advertiser's ads on Facebook Services but only where they agree to restrictions on how they can use the info they collect.
Here is more information about some of the companies advertisers use and the choices they offer:
Do we use cookies if you don't have an account or have logged out of your account?
We still use cookies if you don’t have an account or have logged out of your account. For example, if you have logged out of your account we use cookies to help:
We also set cookies if you don’t have a Facebook account, but have visited facebook.com, to help us protect Facebook Services and the people who use it from malicious activity. For example, these cookies help us detect and prevent denial-of-service attacks and the mass creation of fake accounts.
If you have cookies on your browser or device, we read that cookie when you visit a site with a social plugin.

Technologies like cookies, pixel tags ("pixels"), device or other identifiers and local storage (collectively, “Cookies and similar technologies”) are used to deliver, secure, and understand products, services, and ads, on and off the Facebook Services.
We offer a range of products and features that involve the use of these technologies to reach you based on your activity on and off our Services. You can learn more about our advertising products and the controls you have by visiting our “Advertising on Facebook” page. As described in more detail below, we also use these technologies in other ways, like for security purposes, to deliver and enable products and services, as well as to understand and measure products, services and advertisements. Third parties that you interact with as you use the Facebook Services may also use these technologies for a variety of purposes.
Check back here from time to time to get the latest information about these technologies and how they are used.
Your browser or device may offer settings related to these technologies. For more information about whether these settings are available, what they do, and how they work, visit your browser or device's help material. We may not recognize or respond to browser or device signals around tracking, and some settings may interfere with your use of features we offer. Additionally, the settings offered by a browser or device often only apply to that particular browser or device.
What are some of these technologies?
Cookies are small files that are placed on your browser or device by the website or app you’re using or ad you’re viewing. Pixel tags (also called clear GIFs, web beacons, or pixels) are small blocks of code on a webpage or app that allow them to do things like read and place cookies and transmit information to us or our partners. The resulting connection can include information such as a device’s IP address, the time a person viewed the pixel, an identifier associated with the browser or device and the type of browser being used. Local storage is an industry-standard technology that allows a website or app to store and retrieve data on a person’s computer, mobile phone or other device. Some examples include device or HTML5 local storage and caching.
Why do we use cookies and similar technologies?
We use these technologies for a variety of reasons, such as allowing us to show you content and advertising that’s most relevant to you; improving our products and services; and helping to keep our Services secure. While specific names of the Cookies and similar technologies that we use may change from time to time as we improve and update our Services, they generally fall into the below categories of use:
These technologies tell us when you’re logged in, so we can show you the appropriate experience and features.
For example, Cookies and similar technologies tell us when you are logged in to Facebook so we can show you relevant and social information when you visit other websites that use our social plugins. We also use this information to understand how you use our Platform and other apps and services.
These help keep Facebook Services safe and secure. They support or enable security features and help us detect activity that violates our Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.
For example, they help protect your account from being accessed by anyone other than you. Cookies and similar technologies also let us know when several people have logged in from the same computer. With login approvals if someone logs into your account from a browser you’ve never used before, we may block them and ask for more information. They also help us implement login notifications, so you can be alerted when your account is accessed and disable any active sessions.
Besides helping to keep unauthorized people from logging into your account, we also use Cookies and similar technologies to help make sure the people or machines that access our Services don’t violate our policies. For example, certain information on Facebook is public and therefore can be accessed by anyone on the internet. These Cookies and similar technologies help us understand the volume and frequency of requests so we can detect and stop people or machines from “scraping” information from our site.
We also use these tools to make Facebook easier to use, like when you mistype one character of your username or password. If you’ve already logged into Facebook from the same browser, we’ll give you easier options to correct your typo since we know you’ve successfully logged into Facebook before.
Things like Cookies and similar technologies (such as information about your device or a pixel on a website) are used to understand and deliver ads, make them more relevant to you, and analyze products and services and the use of those products and services.
For example, we use cookies so we, or our affiliates and partners, can serve you ads that may be interesting to you on Facebook Services or other websites and mobile applications. We may also use a cookie to learn whether someone who was served an ad on Facebook Services later makes a purchase on the advertiser’s site or installs the advertised app. Similarly, our partners may use a cookie or another similar technology to determine whether we’ve served an ad and how it performed or provide us with information about how you interact with them. We also may work with an advertiser or its marketing partners to serve you an ad on or off Facebook Services, such as after you’ve visited the advertiser’s site or app, or show you an ad based on the websites you visit or the apps you use – all across the Internet and mobile ecosystem.
We also may use Cookies to provide advertisers with insights about the people who see and interact with their ads, visit their websites, and use their apps.
Learn more about the information we receive, how we decide which ads to show you on and off Facebook Services, and the controls available to you.
These help us provide localized experiences.
For example, we may store information in a cookie that is placed on your browser or device so you will see the site in your preferred language.
These provide functionality that help us deliver products and services.
For example, Cookies or similar technologies help you log in by pre-filling the username field and help make chat a better experience by showing which of your friends are online. We may also use Cookies and similar technologies to help us store preferences, know when you’ve seen or interacted with Facebook Services’ content, and provide you and others with social plugins and other customized content and experiences, such as making suggestions to you and others. Learn more.
We use these to provide you with the best experience possible.
For example, we may use Cookies or similar technologies to help us route traffic between servers and understand how quickly Facebook Services load for different people. Sometimes we may store information on your browser or device so features you are using load and respond faster.
These are used to understand, improve, and research products and services, including when you access Facebook Services or other websites and apps from a computer or mobile device.
For example, we may use Cookies or similar technologies (including information from your device) to understand how you are using social plugins to improve them. We may share information about this analysis with our partners.
You can also take a look at the cookies section of our publicly available audit, carried out by the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner in Ireland, which explains more about the cookies we use.
How do we use cookies, local storage or similar technologies when you use a mobile device?
Many mobile devices act just like computers, such as smart phones that support full-featured browsers. For those devices, we and our partners use Cookies and similar technologies in ways that are similar to when you are accessing the web from a computer. Other devices use different technologies such as local storage on a device, Software Development Kits (SDKs) or Advanced Programming Interfaces (APIs) to facilitate the same types of processes we use Cookies for, as described above.
We may obtain or receive information about your use of your device, our apps, or other apps. As on the web, we also may use these technologies to store an identifier or other information on your device. We describe how we use these technologies and the information we received through their use above. For example, if we learn that you’re already using an app, when you click on a link in News Feed from that app, we can send you directly to that app. If you don’t have the app, we would instead send you to an app store so you could download the app.
How do we use cookies for security purposes?
We use tools like cookies to help keep Facebook Services safe, secure and easy to use. Cookies support or enable security features. For example, with login approvals if someone logs into your account from a browser you’ve never used before, we may block them and ask for more information. They also help us implement login notifications, so you can be alerted when your account is accessed under suspicious circumstances and disable any active Facebook sessions.
Besides helping to keep unauthorized people from logging into your account, we also use cookies to help make sure the people or machines that access our Services don’t violate our policies. For example, certain information on our Services is public and therefore can be accessed by anyone on the Internet. These cookies help us understanding the volume and frequency of requests so we can detect and stop people or machines from “scraping” information from our site.
We also use these tools to make our Services easier to use, like when you mistype one character of your username or password. For example, if you’ve already logged into Facebook from the same browser, we’ll give you easier options to correct your typo since we know you’ve successfully logged into Facebook before.
When might we use cookies, device identifiers, local storage or similar technologies?
We may place or use these technologies when you interact with our Services, our related companies, or with an advertiser or partner (whether or not you are logged in to the particular Service) using a browser or device that permits the placement or use of the relevant technology. For example, when you visit our site or use our app, we may place or read cookies or receive information from your devices. We may also place cookies through a pixel on an advertiser’s or partner’s site.
When might we read the cookies on your computer or device?
Web browsers send any cookies for a particular web domain (ex: facebook.com) to the website each time a machine with those cookies accesses content served from that domain. This means that any facebook.com cookies will be sent to Facebook when any page is accessed at facebook.com by that machine. It also means that these cookies are sent to Facebook when someone accesses a third-party website or application that integrates or uses our Services, like one of our plugins.
Sometimes we work with websites, apps and their partners so that we can place or read Facebook cookies on your browsers or devices when you visit third-party services. This allows us to do things like read and reference cookies from more than one device or browser that you use, on and off of our Services, so we can provide you Facebook Services across all of your devices and improve and understand the products, ads and services we offer to you and others across the Internet.
How do third parties use cookies, pixel tags ("pixels") and other similar technologies on our Services?
We sometimes use service providers to help us provide certain products and services. For example, we use service providers to help you buy things using Facebook on your mobile phone. As part of those services, a provider may use a pixel to collect information about your phone so that, if you choose, it can help us conveniently bill you through your regular phone bill.
When you view, click or otherwise interact with an ad or app on or off Facebook, our partners also use cookies, pixels or similar technologies (like local storage or information from your device), to help provide you with relevant services and ads. For example, a platform partner may use cookies, software developer kits (SDKs) or similar technologies to customize your experience while you’re using their app. Or, an advertising partner may use a cookie to decide whether they want us to show you one of their ads or to measure the performance of the ads you see. Our partners also may use these technologies to help share information with our Services, like how you use their website or app.
We or others (like your friends in their posts or the Pages or apps you visit or use) may integrate third party features like maps or videos to provide you with better services. The providers of those integrations may collect information when you view or use them, including information about you and your device or browser. They may do this using Cookies or similar technologies. To learn more about the information they collect or receive, review their privacy policies.
How do we use Cookies and similar technologies to show relevant ads?
We use Cookies and similar technologies to show you ads on and off Facebook Services. Learn more about how Facebook decides which ads to show you and the controls available to you. You can adjust your ad preferences if you want to control and manage your ad experience on Facebook.
The advertising companies we work with generally use cookies and similar technologies as part of their services. When they do so, they often adhere to industry-standard controls that you can use or they may offer other choices as well. To learn more about how advertisers generally use cookies and the choices they offer, you can review the following resources:

You'll find an audience selector tool most places you share status updates, photos and other things you post. Tap the audience selector tool to choose who you want to share something with.


The tool remembers the audience you shared with the last time you posted something and uses the same audience when you share again unless you change it. For example, if you choose Public for a post, your next post will also be Public unless you change the audience when you post. This one tool appears in multiple places, such as your privacy shortcuts and privacy settings. When you make a change to the audience selector tool in one place, the change updates the tool everywhere it appears.
The audience selector also appears alongside things you've already shared, so it's clear who can see each post. After you've shared a post, you have the option to change who it's shared with.
Remember, when you post to another person's Timeline, that person controls what audience can view the post. Additionally, anyone who gets tagged in a post may see it, along with their friends.
Learn more about the audiences you can choose from when you share.

Facebook is a fan of open source software. We are heavy users of packages like PHP, MySQL, Memcache and also believe in contributing technology like Thrift and Scribe back to the community. It's interesting not just to hear that companies are using open source software (everyone is!) but rather about how they adapt the software to better suit their needs.
The video and slides linked to below provide details on our particular usage patterns as well as the various optimizations and modifications we have made over the years. In addition to the core web-tier stack, we also have a number of custom backend services that power products like NewsFeed and Search. The slides give an overview of the services (!php) stack and the various toolsets that allow Facebook engineers to easily develop, deploy, monitor and maintain code written in a variety of languages like C++ and Erlang.
