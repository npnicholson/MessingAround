If you’re in the market for a job, an investment, or a business to run in your off-hours or as an encore career, there are some mighty convincing promoters out there who promise high returns, low risk, and ‘golden’ opportunities just waiting for the right buyer. Take the time to ask the questions that can keep you from getting ripped off.
If you’re looking for a job, you may see ads for firms that promise results. Unfortunately, some job placement firms misrepresent their services, promote nonexistent vacancies, or charge high fees in advance for services that don’t guarantee placement.
There are all kinds of home-based businesses, including ones that are set up to fail. Scammers make appealing — but not always truthful — pitches for medical billing businesses, envelope stuffing schemes, and craft and assembly projects, knowing that many people must find ways to work from home.
If you’re considering putting money into a business opportunity, do some research first. By law, business opportunity promoters must give you certain information before you hand over any money.
Do your research before you commit to an alternative investment or money-making opportunity. Promises of “free money,” mysterious financial models, and outsize returns most likely are scams.

When National Consumer Protection Week starts on Sunday, it will mark the 17th year of a growing partnership. NCPW now includes 89 federal, state and local agencies and non-profits working together to connect people with the best consumer education resources.
At NCPW.gov, you’ll find resources to help you manage your money, handle credit and debt, stay safe online, avoid identity theft, and more. Read the latest news from consumer protection experts on our blog; share videos, articles, audio tips, and blog posts; order free resources; or file a complaint when you spot a scam. You’ll also get ideas on how to get involved so you can help us spread the word about consumer protection.
Earlier this week – in keeping with NCPW’s partnership theme and the FTC’s commitment to fighting fraud in every community – we participated in a roundtable with the US Department of Justice and the US Postal Inspection Service, both NCPW partners. We were joined by legal services organizations, consumer advocacy groups, and other non-profits to discuss scams that target older adults and the Latino community. 
The message we heard? The three agencies have done a lot to protect these communities from scams, including law enforcement actions and creative consumer education – but there’s still more to be done. And, as Jonathan Olin, Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the US Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch, said, “The Department of Justice’s Consumer Protection Branch and the FTC continue to work together to stop fraud schemes that prey on all Americans. With the help of consumer groups, we hope to increase awareness so that people know how to avoid these schemes when confronted with them.”
What scams do you see in your community? And what will you be doing for National Consumer Protection Week? Please tell us in the comments, below – or join us on Twitter: follow @FTC and tweet #NCPW2015 to join the conversation on Tues., March 3, 2015 at 2:00 pm ET.
But let’s not stop with NCPW. We’re here every week of every year, working to protect you from frauds and scams. Join us. You can help: talk about the scams you see. Report them to us. And use the NCPW resources, this week and throughout the year.
Was awakened by a woman who claimed to b from Washington, DC, could not understand a word;clearly Nigerian or other country from same region? So she gets her partner in crime (sorry couldn't catch the names if illegally USA names) but then wide awake as I listened to their scheme, because after getting a few; they're more & more convincing; this call was intended to getting as much info to steal my computer info. Luckily I told him "hey slow down, if I do have this virus he knew sooo much about, I'd send my newly bought LTOP back. He then replied no, all I need is $144.99 & he'd fix it right up! So GOD was watching over me! Thank you, dear GOD! He's always pulling me away from the devils nasty arrows Anyway, please update & add this new scheme to your last of the newer ones?

I am sick, my animals keep getting sick...why?because I was scammed and the seller committed fraud when I purchased his home. I have been fighting this for a year and no help to be found. I am 69 years old, 2 weeks after moving in, the basement began to flood. He completely painted the basement so no one would notice...even FHA!!! I have written to every Health Dept, Consumers Protection Agency, President Obama, the Attorney General's Office...the list goes on and on. I don't have the money to have this house fixed or to pay a lot of money for an attorney. Some Consumers Protection Agency, and I know, you'll say we don't get involved with cases like yours!!

Federal officials, consumer advocates, and businesses are hearing from people who have responded to ads, websites, phone calls, text messages, and visits from salespeople who claim the federal government will pay their bills – for everything from utilities, cable, and cell phones to their mortgages, student loans, and insurance premiums. The salespeople are scam artists. There is no federal bank account set up to pay your bills.
It's enough to make you sick. No sooner had the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the Affordable Care Act than scam artists began working the phones. Claiming to be from the government, they're saying that under the Affordable Care Act, they need to verify some information. For example, they might have the routing number of the person's bank, and then use that information to get the person to reveal the entire account number. Other times, they have asked for credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, Medicare ID, or other personal information.

The FTC cautions you not to give out personal or financial information in response to unsolicited phone calls, emails, or knocks on your door. Scam artists want your information to commit identity theft, charge your existing credit cards, debit your checking account, open new credit card, checking, or savings accounts, write fraudulent checks, or take out loans in your name.
If you get a call from someone who claims to be from the government and who asks for your personal information, hang up. It's a scam. The government and legitimate organizations with which you do business have the information they need and will not ask you for it. Then, file a complaint at ftc.gov/complaint or call toll-free, 1-877-FTC-HELP. If you think your identity's been stolen, visit ftc.gov/idtheft or call 1-877-ID-THEFT. You also can file a complaint with your state Attorney General.

Health insurance is changing under the Affordable Care Act. Starting on October 1, 2013, people who are uninsured or who buy their own coverage can sign up for health insurance through the Health Insurance Marketplace. Why write about this now, if enrollment doesn’t start until October? Because we’ve already heard from consumers and other federal agencies that scammers are trying to convince people to act, and give up money or personal information. Scammers want to get to you before you have time to think.
You can’t sign up now, but you can start learning about your choices and get ready to enroll. Go to HealthCare.gov, or call 1-800-318-2596, 24 hours a day, seven days a week to talk with a customer service representative. Go to the site — or call — again in October to create your account and shop for qualified health plans.
And please: if you see someone trying to enroll people for health insurance under the Act before October 1, 2013, say something. Every report helps us find and stop the bad guys. If you get a call like this, report it to the FTC. The phone number on your caller ID — if there is one — or the caller’s name or location — is helpful information for investigators and fraud fighters. You can report online or by phone, toll-free, at 1-877-FTC-HELP. Your report might help stop the scammers, and it could help keep others from being scammed.
What is the benefit of this change in insurance ? Will retired people on a fixed income get a break on the overall cost? Also, will it include dental and vision insurance if not why even bother changing it?
What are the advantages of this new insurance particularly to pensioners?
I think this is a fraud. I received, in the mail, a prescription card that looks like it is from the federal government. Comes with a pamphlet titled "10 Frequently Asked Questions About Your United States Prescription Discount Card" Has a return Address of United States Prescription Discounts 5614 Connecticut Ave, NW #526 Washington, DC 20015-2604. The Letter is addressed New Member, claims the card is because of the affordable care act, and is signed Steven Harrell Benefits Coordinator. It refers to Form 0813 Script Relief. The Phone number to call is 1-888-607-3001 Bottom of letter has Cat. No. USPD0813ALT LT 4
You were right to be suspicious! Don't reply, and report the scam at ftc.gov/complaint.
WOW! This is great...

So, a frog hops into a bar and says, “Hey, did you hear the one about DermaTend?” Apparently, explained the frog, ads said this product removed moles, skin tags and warts — fast and permanently. Better yet, it was supposedly doctor-recommended and clinically proven. Said the frog, “Sounds like the answer to a frog’s dream, right? But then I heard the FTC just filed a complaint in federal court charging the advertiser, Solace International, with deceptive advertising. And that’s no joke.”
According to the FTC — and the frog — Solace charged $39.95 for a pinkie-sized tube of DermaTend and an emery board. The instructions told users to file the mole, skin tag, or wart with the emery board, apply DermaTend, and then wash it off after 45 minutes. But, according to the FTC, this approach was neither doctor-recommended nor clinically proven. Today, the FTC announced that the advertiser has signed an order settling the case. Bottom line: If a business says its health product can do something, the company must have competent and reliable scientific evidence to back it up.
According to the frog, “If you want to get rid of warts, moles or skin tags, it’s best to first check with a healthcare professional. When it comes to treatments for health conditions, it can be tough to tell products and services that work from bottled pond mud. And,” added the frog, “there’s no truth to the myth that frogs cause warts.”
Is DermaNail a product by the same manufacturer as DermaTend? Is it a scam as well? Thanks.

Everyone wants to feel safe in their home, so when home security salespeople come knocking, their pitch can be convincing. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), the nation's consumer protection agency, and your state Attorney General urge you to use caution when you consider what security system sales agents have to offer.
During the spring and summer months, home security or alarm companies hire traveling sales agents to go door-to-door, making unsolicited "cold calls" on homeowners. In some cases, the salespeople use high-pressure or deceptive sales tactics to get potential customers to buy expensive, and sometimes substandard, systems or equipment they don't need.
Before you let anyone inside your home, ask for identification. Some state laws require door-to-door salespeople to tell you their name, the name of the business they represent, and the goods or services they wish to sell before asking you any questions or making any statements. Other states require salespeople to show you their "pocket card" license and a photo ID. Take a few minutes to look over their documentation.
Unscrupulous door-to-door sales agents use a variety of approaches and pitches to get you to buy an alarm system and monitoring services. Here's what to look out for:
Some door-to-door sales agents target homeowners who have signs on their properties for security systems with other companies. In these cases:
Before you do business with anyone selling a home security or alarm system, whether they come to your door or you seek them out, the FTC and your state Attorney General urge you to ask potential contractors for the following information. Use it to check out the alarm company with the appropriate authorities: your state Attorney General, local consumer protection agency, Better Business Bureau, and state licensing officials. If the salesperson is reluctant to give you this information, consider it a red flag and find another company to consider.
Home security systems are designed to protect you, your home, and your valuables. They vary in price and sophistication. Some systems not only can warn you of intruders, but also can notify authorities of a medical emergency, monitor smoke and carbon monoxide and water levels or pressures, and include video surveillance. Some systems also are linked into your home's wiring, heating or lighting systems and use your mobile phone or computer to control them.
Most home security alarm installers can provide all-inclusive services that include equipment plus the installation and monitoring service.
If you're thinking about buying a home security system, the FTC and your state Attorney General suggest that you:
Get references from your friends, family, neighbors, co-workers and from the company's current clients. Find out whether the equipment was installed within the given time frame. Were any equipment problems dealt with promptly? Was the system explained to everyone living in the home? If there was an intrusion, were the police contacted immediately?
Check out the companies by entering their names in a search engine online. Read about other people's experiences with the companies. Try to communicate offline if possible to clarify any details. In addition, contact your state Attorney General, local consumer protection agency, and the Better Business Bureau to see if any complaints are on file.
Verify that the contractor's licenses are current and in good standing. Check with the National Association of State Contractors Licensing Agencies for the appropriate agency in your state.
Get written estimates from several companies, and ask plenty of questions. A reputable company will not try to sell you anything before completing a professional assessment of your needs and the layout of your home. Find out:
Read the fine print. Once you've chosen a company, make sure the written contract includes all oral promises made by the salesperson. Your contract package should include:
The contract also must be dated, and show the name and address of the seller.
Contact your police and fire departments. Ask whether you need to register your system, and if there are fines for responding to false alarms.
Understand that you can cancel the deal. The FTC's Cooling-Off Rule gives you three business days to cancel the deal if you sign the contract in your home or at a location that is not the seller's permanent place of business. You do not have to give a reason for canceling your purchase. You have a right to change your mind, even if the equipment has already been installed.
The salesperson must give you two copies of a cancellation form (one to keep and one to send back) and a copy of your contract. The contract must be dated, show the name and address of the seller, and explain your right to cancel. You may have additional consumer protections under state law. Check with your state Attorney General, local consumer protection agency, or the Better Business Bureau.

i am in need of some where to live because now i am staying with a relative
that is great.
I live in an acceptable senior complex and they still allow smoking. Smoke is entering my apt thru the vent. I have tried so many things and no one can do anything because they don't smell it. It does not happen 24-7.
My concern is why are apartment owners allowed to use credit ratings in a relationship that is not credit based. When a owner advertises a rental and a renter signs a lease and the owner accepts the lease, it is not a credit relationship, the owner is not extending credit, the lessee is not getting something on time. Moreover, unlike many credit relationships, owners have immediate and swift access to the courts and eviction in the event of nonpayment. I think this fact is a stark reminder of how credit ratings are inappropriately used and I think the FTC can stop this activity. Too many renters are being deprived of the basic tenets of live, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness because barriers are created to keep them out of decent places to live.
Georgia, The apt owner needs to be reassured that the new renter is going to pay their rent and not distroy the unit. Thus, the apt owner does credit checks to make sure of these criterias before signing any agreements.
When owners do a credit check, they want to make sure you can afford to pay the entire duration of lease, thus good and bad credit. The other part of credit check is calling other owners where you have rented. Because, court costs the apt owner substantiable fees if the renter defaults the agreement with owner.
Auto insurance is based on your driving history. Yes, it can be costly and seemed not fair because, by law have to have auto ins and penalized if you had claims and violations.
Have you ever needed some help because of lack of income and tried to recieve food supplements?. The auto you drive is counted as an asset in most cases, though the auto insurance doesn't count as an deduction from income. That ain't fair
I wholeheartedly agree with Georgia! Another example is automobile insurance companies do the same thing and again it is not a credit relationship. This should be stopped as it is getting out of hand. What has happened to our individual rights?
While I DO agree with Georgia regarding housing, I'm afraid that I have to disagree with you, Nevada 25. There is a key difference that makes automobile and even "renter's" insurance a "credit" transaction.
When you get insurance on your vehicle, there is a total price (aka premium) stated for the policy coverage period, say 6-month duration as an example. Unless you pay the policy premium up-front (and they generally don't even offer you that option), you are making monthly payment towards that policy premium. Therefore, they have give you credit for the cost of the premium and the payment duration is the length of the policy purchased.
So, sad to say, it truly IS a credit transaction. And they generally charge an nominal fee even for automatic payment withdrawal and/or "account maintenance fee". State Farm charges me a extra $1 each month for this.
My rent take majority of my disability check and I'VE been placing my name on waiting list for senior housing.It's been hard not. Being able to buy food or pay bills in full or purchase medicine when the price is only $2.65. Being able to move is my only answer even moving out of Chicago.

Need to rent a car for your vacation or business travels? Comparing prices online can save you a bundle. But make sure you compare the total cost — not just the advertised rate — because fees and options can increase the base price dramatically.
Keep these things in mind as you start your search for a rental car.
The size of the rental car can impact the price you pay. Terms like "compact," "mid-size," and "luxury" can vary across rental car companies. To illustrate car sizes, companies usually provide car models or suggest how many passengers the car seats safely.
Search across several websites for the type of car you’re interested in renting. To get an idea of the best price you can get, search for rates at individual rental car company websites and price comparison websites.
If your travel plans are flexible, you may be able to rent a car when price breaks are available. Try searching for specials geared to the length of time you need the vehicle. You may find better deals if you book in advance, or book in combination with a flight or hotel. Read any fine print about restrictions on special offers, including blackout dates when an advertised price may not be available. Some companies also offer special rates for seniors or members of particular organizations, like motor clubs.
Comparing advertised rates for rental cars may not give you an accurate picture of the price you will pay. Try to make an “apples to apples” comparison of car rental prices that includes all mandatory fees and charges, as well as charges for options.
Some fees may be quoted when you reserve a car online, though you may not find out about all of the charges until you go to the rental office to pick up your car. Read your contract carefully, and look for fees triggered by specific events — like accidents.
Many companies check driving records when customers arrive at the counter, and reject those whose records don't meet company standards. Even if you have a confirmed reservation, you may be disqualified from renting a car for recent violations, including:
Ask the rental car company in advance whether they check customers’ driving records.
Rental companies usually offer drivers additional coverage options — for a price. If you buy their coverage, they say you can minimize your liability while driving their rental car. However, you may be covered already through your own auto or homeowner's policies. Read your insurance policies for specifics, and call your insurers if you're uncertain about the coverage. If you're traveling on business, you may be covered under your employer’s insurance. Some credit card companies and motor clubs provide members with free rental protection when you use their cards to pay for rentals.
Salespeople also may try to sell you a Collision Damage Waiver (CDW), or a Loss Damage Waiver. These waivers guarantee that the rental company will pay for damages to your rental car. It’s not technically collision insurance — the company won’t pay for any injuries to you or damages to your personal property. Coverage under your medical insurance plan might offer protection that CDW coverage lacks.
If you don’t buy CDW coverage or aren’t covered by your personal auto insurance policy, you accept responsibility for any damages — and could be liable for the full value of the car. Some rental companies hold you liable only for a portion of the value.
If you purchase CDW, your coverage still could be revoked if you damage the rental car while:
Rental car companies may offer other coverage options for additional charges. Prices and policies for coverage vary among companies. If you decide to pay for extra coverage, ask for details.
Ask about fees before you rent a car to avoid surprises when you pay your bill. Here are some common fees and charges you may encounter.
The rental company will add on the required state, city, or county taxes — and their own sales tax rates — to the price of your rental car. You may see other fees, too, like a “vehicle licensing fee” or an “energy recovery fee.”
Being early is not always a good thing. Some rental companies may charge a fee if you return the car more than 24 hours before your reservation was supposed to end. If you must return the car early, call the company to talk to an agent.
Running a little late? Many rental car companies have short grace periods that allow you to return the car without a fee if you’re late by less than 30 minutes. However, you still may have to pay a full day’s charge for optional items, like navigation systems and liability coverage options. If you’re running more than a half hour late, call the company to see if it’s cheaper to pay late charges or extend your rental.
If you’re renting a car at the airport, fees can increase the rental rate considerably. These surcharges can apply even when rental car companies shuttle you to their off-site lot.
Most companies require you to return your rental car with a full tank of gas. If you don't, you'll be charged the rental company's price for gas, which is virtually always more expensive than if you refill the tank yourself at a local station. Companies might give you the option of pre-purchasing a full tank of gas when you first take the car, so you can return the car without paying an additional fee to fuel up. There’s usually no refund for unused fuel.
Most rental car companies now offer unlimited miles. But daily mileage caps may apply based on the type of vehicle you rent (for example, some SUVs or high performance vehicles). It helps to know about how far you plan to drive so you can select the company that offers the most favorable mileage terms.
Ask whether roadside assistance is included in the price of your rental car, or if the company will charge you a fee for it. If the company charges for a roadside service plan, find out exactly what it will cover if you need help — for example, if you have a flat tire or lock your keys in the car. If you’re a member of a motor club, you may have free or low-cost roadside assistance through your membership.
Before you head out on a road trip, check whether your rental company allows you to drive out of the state or geographical area in which you rented the car. Ask about the charges to drive out of state.
Need to drop your car off at a location other than where you picked it up? You may have to pay a steep fee for that.
If you’d like to include extra items in your rental car — like a navigation system or a car seat — you’ll have to pay a fee. Reserve these items in advance; availability varies based on the location of the rental.
Want to switch off driving duties? Some companies charge a fee to add another driver — even your spouse — to your contract.
You don’t have to be 25 to rent a car. Drivers between the ages of 21 and 24 are allowed to rent cars — for an additional fee.
Most rental companies place a hold — or a block — on your debit or credit card to protect themselves from possible charges beyond the authorized amount. They don't process the blocked amount unless you fail to return the car as specified in your contract. Your spending limit on your card may be reduced by the blocked amount until shortly after you return the car.

If you aren’t satisfied with a product or service, these tips and strategies can help you resolve the problem.
